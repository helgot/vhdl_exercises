2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net rom_i/rom[10]_9 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin rom_i/rom_reg[10][15]_i_1/O, cell rom_i/rom_reg[10][15]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net rom_i/rom[11]_10 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin rom_i/rom_reg[11][15]_i_1/O, cell rom_i/rom_reg[11][15]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
